# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


"Nexio" is a suggestion based on creating a concise and modern-sounding name for a contact management system. It's short, easy to remember, and has a contemporary feel. The "Nex" prefix could imply the idea of moving forward or the next step, which aligns with the concept of managing contacts and interactions. Additionally, the "-io" suffix adds a technological touch, as it's commonly associated with tech-related terms.

Of course, the choice of a web name is highly subjective, and different names resonate differently with different people. "Nexio" is just one option among many, and the final decision should consider your target audience, branding strategy, and the overall image you want to project for your contact management system.
